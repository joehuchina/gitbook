I have being working as a datacenter engineer and solution architect over 10 years at several big global IT companies .

My career started as a Network Engineer at 2008  and then I was moved to some projects related with Vmware , EMC NetApp storage ,openstack and AWS etc. 

Be frankly I enjoyed these changes and since then Im trying to get more and more information about datacenter and cloud technologies .

I was certified as

* AWS certified solution architect\(Professional \)

* OpenStack Foundation certified Administrator
* RedHat certified  Engineer
* NetApp certified Storage Administrator
* Juniper certified Specialist \(Security &Router \)
* ITILv3 Foundation
