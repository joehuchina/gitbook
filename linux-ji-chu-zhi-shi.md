# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

这里是我通过麻省理工的6.0001课程学习计算机科学和如何使用Python编程的笔记

_6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python_

is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.

这门课为了没有编程经验的人设计的，帮助学生理解计算机如何帮助人们解决问题。帮助不同学科的人自如的使用python编写一些小程序来辅助自己。这门课是基于python3.5的。
