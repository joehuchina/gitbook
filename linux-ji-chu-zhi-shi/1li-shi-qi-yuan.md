1个小时时间，MIT的计算机基础。

新手要注意的是不要被动吸收，而是不断的练习再练习。

* 基本概念：knowledge of concepts
* 编程能力:Programming skill
* 编程的核心：problem solving 



# 学习目标：

Learning how to program, part of it is figuring out what **objects** to create. You'll learn about these later. How do you represent knowledge with **data structures**? That's sort of the broad term for that.

怎样创建对象？怎样用数据结构来展现？

* represent knowledge with **data structures**   使用数据结构来展现知识
* iteration 迭代 and recursion 递归 as computational metaphors 
* abstraction of procedures and **data types**  
* **organize** and **modularize **systems using **object classes **and **methods **
* different classes of **algorithms**, searching and sorting 
* complexity of algorithms

## What does computer do ?

Fundamentally: 

*  performs calculations a billion calculations per second! 
*  remembers results 100s of gigabytes of storage! 

What kinds of calculations? 

* built-in to the language 
* ones that you define as the programmer 

computers only know what you tell them
